Put your charts here, it should look something like this:

assets/shared/data/your-song-name/
---- ./your-song-name-easy.json
---- ./your-song-name.json
---- ./your-song-name-hard.json
---- ./events.json
---- ./preload.json

ALSO, NOTE FROM BRAINY

The playableCharacterList.txt file's format is 

INTERNAL CHARACTER NAME, ICON NAME, DISPLAY NAME, BACKGROUND COLOR (as hex)

i may make a simple editor for this idk
